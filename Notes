RFC 4180 formalized CSV. It defines the MIME type "text/csv", and CSV files that follow its rules should be very widely portable. Among its requirements:

    MS-DOS-style lines that end with (CR/LF) characters (optional for the last line)
    An optional header record (there is no sure way to detect whether it is present, so care is required when importing).
    Each record "should" contain the same number of comma-separated fields.
    Any field may be quoted (with double quotes).
    Fields containing a line-break, double-quote, and/or commas should be quoted. (If they are not, the file will likely be impossible to process correctly).
    A (double) quote character in a field must be represented by two (double) quote characters.

1. All records in a csv file have the same number of fileds.
2. If the records have multiple fields, the field separator is a literal, often a comma.
3. If the records have only one field, no field separator presents.
4. To identify the beginning of a record. We need three symbols: part I the beginning of line symbol, part II whitespace(s), part III the beginning symbol of a field.
5. To identify the end of a record. We need three symbols: part I the end of a filed symbol, part II whitespace(s), part III the end of line symbol.
6. A record is defined by from inclusive part 4 III to inclusive part 5 I.
7. the beginning symbol of a field can be identified by
7.1 I beginning of stream with, II with or without white space(s), III end of line 
7.2 I beginning of stream with, II with or without white space(s), III field separator
7.3 I beginning of stream with, II with or without white space(s), III field separator
